          I have a varied background in both in the computer industry and other
          fields. I have served over 7 years in the navy and then worked for
          over 15 years in a high-tech company that produces highly complex
          computer system for military use. Even though I didn't have an
          official computer education I was able to join the system engineering
          department and was involved in many highly complex projects. I have
          also a Bachelor degree in Law and I completed my PhD in German
          Philosophy. In recent years I have worked as a Tour Guide in the
          Berlin area but post COVID-19 I decided to go back to the field of
          computers. Over the last few months I have taught myself HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, jQuery, Sass, React, Redux and more in order to find my
          way as a Frontend Developer. I am highly motivated, passionate about
          programing and system design and eager to learn new things.
